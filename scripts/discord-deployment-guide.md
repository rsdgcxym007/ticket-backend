## Manual Discord Notification Testing

To test if Discord notifications are working:
```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -X POST \
     -d '{"content": "üß™ Manual test from ticket-backend deployment system"}' \
     "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1404715794205511752/H4H1Q-aJ2B1LwSpKxHYP7rt4tCWA0p10339NN5Gy71fhwXvFjcfSQKXNl9Xdj60ks__l"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Discord Notifications Not Working
1. Check internet connectivity
2. Verify webhook URL is correct
3. Ensure curl is installed
4. Check Discord server permissions

2. Verify Node.js version compatibility
3. Check database connection
4. Verify environment variables
